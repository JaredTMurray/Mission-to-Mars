# Module_11_Challenge

## Mission to Mars Overview:


## Results:
### Deliverable 1: 
A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars news titles and preview text.
-	Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). (10 points)
-	The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. (20 points)
-	The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries. (10 points)


### Deliverable 2: 
A Jupyter notebook containing code that scrapes the Mars weather data and that cleans, visualizes, and analyzes that data.
-	The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types. (15 points)
-	The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer: (40 points)
 -	How many months exist on Mars?
 - 	Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
 -	Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
 -	How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made.
-	The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file. (5 points)


## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
